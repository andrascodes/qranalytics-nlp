    "<li> **`min_df`**: this could be an integer (e.g. 5) and the term would have to be in at least 5 of the documents to be considered. Here I pass 0.2; the term must be in at least 20% of the document. I found that if I allowed a lower `min_df` I ended up basing clustering on names--for example \"Michael\" or \"Tom\" are names found in several of the movies and the synopses use these names frequently, but the names carry no real meaning.\n",
